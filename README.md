# Dive into the Project
This project contains many sections, Here's an overview of each section:
* This project is a robot that is controlled by arduino, contains many sensors and motors to help it navigate in the field freely
* This robot detect a QR code that contains the information about the certain plant
* It then takes serval photos of it, then sends them via Rasberry Pi to a model programmed using Python language to detect and classify the plant as healthy or not
* This robot also collect data as humidity, light instensity and temperature, in order to help the farmer specify the cause behind the diseases
* The detection of the disease and its classification is done using a CNN model calle *"Retinanet"* 
# The Datasets Used
* This repository contains a curated dataset of high-resolution images of healthy and diseases plant leaves, collected and annotated manually. Whether you're exploring the world of machine learning, or developing your own models for leaf classification, or conducting research in plant science, this dataset is a valuable resource. Dive into the rich and varied world of plant leaves, complete with detailed annotations, and unlock new possibilities for image analysis, pattern recognition, and more.
